/**
 * Canonical canary marker strings for the E2E/integration suites. These MIRROR the `pattern:`
 * values in threats/dummy.yaml — the detection source of truth — and e2e-canary-markers.test.ts
 * asserts every value here exists there, so the two can't silently diverge. Import these instead
 * of hardcoding the opaque strings: a marker rotation then touches this file + dummy.yaml only
 * (not ~15 scattered literals), and a test-side typo becomes a compile error rather than a
 * silently-passing test (the const name doesn't exist).
 *
 * Names follow dummy.yaml's id matrix: `<tool><Decision>[Variant]` (e.g. DUMMY-CMD-DENY-001 →
 * `cmdDenyAlpha`). URL/domain values are the BARE host — the dummy.yaml rule appends `\.test`,
 * so tests compose the full `https://${…}.test/…` URL themselves.
 *
 * NOTE: the VS Code/Cursor Extension Host suite (e2e-suite/index.js) is hand-written runtime CJS
 * that can't import this module, so it keeps its own local copies — covered by the registry test.
